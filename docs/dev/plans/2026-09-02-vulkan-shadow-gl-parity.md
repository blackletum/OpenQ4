# Vulkan shadow maps — OpenGL parity closure (staging plan)

Status: S1-S8 LANDED (2026-09-02). One item is deliberately left open and one
is deliberately out of scope; both are named below. S1, S2 and S5 change
runtime behaviour that token pins cannot fully cover, and still want the
user's own gameplay sign-off.

Goal doc for the remaining Vulkan shadow-mapping gaps after Phase
F2a/F2b + the 2026-07-24 shadow parity follow-up. Parent:
[2026-07-19-vulkan-phase-f.md](2026-07-19-vulkan-phase-f.md);
stencil/F3 record: [2026-07-20-vulkan-phase-g.md](2026-07-20-vulkan-phase-g.md).

Scope: bring `r_renderApi vk` shadow mapping to the behaviour, cost, and
diagnosability of the OpenGL path. Out of scope: translucent shadow
moments (`r_shadowMapTranslucentMoments`, experimental, default 0 — the
Phase F closure deliberately excludes it on Vulkan), the modern
clustered receiver path (`ModernClusteredLighting`, GL-only by design),
and the `r_useShadowMap` default flip (separate, user-gated).

## Audit ground truth (2026-09-02)

Most `r_shadowMap*` cvars that never appear under `src/renderer/Vulkan/`
are still honoured there — they reach Vulkan through the shared
`R_ShadowMapProjectedFilterSettings`,
`R_BuildShadowMapProjectedLightState`, and `ClassicInteractionDomain`
seals. A cvar-name grep overstates the gap. Vulkan already had CSM,
the 1/5/9/13 PCF tiers, rotated Poisson, PCSS-lite, receiver-plane
bias, normal-offset, hashed alpha, caster culling, subview policy,
update budgets, and both the projected-atlas and point-cube static
caches. The verified remainder was:

| # | Gap | Landed as |
| - | --- | --------- |
| S1 | stencil volumes never elided | `22eb0060` |
| S2 | no cached-static + dynamic compose | `742c7b91` |
| S3 | no CSM static caching | `2bc4b5ff` |
| S4 | no receiver debug modes | `981583bf` (overlay still open) |
| S5 | no importance-ordered admission | `c188c798` |
| S6 | thin `r_shadowMapReport` | `b930d486` |
| S7 | `r_shadowMapPointHighPrecision` inert | `b930d486` |
| S8 | no GPU shadow-pass timings | this commit |

## Correction to the 2026-07-24 Vulkan stencil-elision revert

The Phase G "Same-frame fallback amendment" kept
`RB_ShadowMapResourcesKnownGood` conservative on Vulkan because an
Air Defense run had a light whose volume was elided before the backend
learned its admission could not be satisfied, and "the affected receiver
had to be skipped fail-closed".

That hazard no longer exists. `vk_Interactions.cpp` now draws the
receiver unshadowed when nothing else resolved — "a transient loss of
shadowing is preferable to dropping the light contribution for a
complete frame" — which is exactly the OpenGL contract
(`RB_ShadowMapMarkStencilFallbackSticky` then a stencil fallback over a
possibly empty volume chain). The conservative return was therefore
over-conservative relative to the code it guarded, and S1 flipped it.

Residual per-view Vulkan-specific miss sources after S1: atlas row-scan
exhaustion, point-cube pool exhaustion, and caster representability.
Each costs one unshadowed frame plus a sticky restore, which is the
cost OpenGL already accepts. The shared front-end mirror
(`R_ShadowMapLightWillUseShadowMaps`) already refuses to elide under a
non-zero `r_shadowMapMaxUpdatesPerView` or in a subview with a non-zero
`r_shadowMapSubviewPolicy`, so those two policies cannot strand an
elided light on either backend.

## Landed record (2026-09-02)

S1. `VK_ShadowMap_ResourcesKnownGood` reports the per-light-class
    generation truth it already tracked. Shadow-mapped lights no longer
    extrude and link silhouette volumes nothing draws. The fail-open
    receiver contract is pinned so the 2026-07-24 shape cannot return
    unnoticed.

S2. Cached-static + dynamic-caster composition for projected lights. A
    pass that publishes or restores a cache entry renders its static
    chains only; after publication and restore a second depth scope with
    loadOp LOAD draws just the dynamic chains into the same tile. A
    composed cache hit revalidates the caster pipeline and
    representability that an exact hit normally inherits from the update
    which published its signature.

    Composition is a legacy-walker feature on BOTH backends: the sealed
    domain sets `allowCacheReuse` false for any pass with dynamic
    casters, and OpenGL composes only in `RB_ARB2_DrawInteractions`.
    Vulkan keeps the old conservative rule while
    `r_rendererSharedWorldInteraction` can own the view, so a composed
    hit can never fail the domain's physical reconciliation. That
    coupling is load-bearing — see the comment at the `composeDynamic`
    assignment.

S3. CSM static caching behind `r_shadowMapCacheCSM`. Resident projected
    entries carry the physical block edge (`tileSize * atlasDiv`); the
    image is created at that edge, a slot reused at a different edge
    retires its image first, and the edge joins the entry's identity so
    a lookup cannot return a differently shaped block. Reuse restores
    the resident fit along with the tiles, so it is self-consistent but
    deliberately stale — which is why the cvar defaults off.

S4. Receiver debug modes in both Vulkan interaction shaders, driven
    through the shadow ABI. Coordinate rejection moved into a shared
    `ProjectShadowCoord` so the invalid-mask view classifies exactly
    what sampling rejected; the selected cascade and split blend are
    recorded during sampling so a view describes the sample the lit path
    took. Mode 10 is caster-side and zeroes the shadow pass's offsets.
    Modes 13/14 upload reason 0 because Vulkan admits shadow maps per
    light, not per receiver surface.

S5. Importance-ordered update admission. Cost is the ownership maps a
    light would render fresh; score is screen coverage, staleness of its
    newest resident content, and whether the camera stands inside the
    light. The estimate is side-effect free (read-only peers of the
    cacheability test, both resident lookups, and the history lookup),
    because the scheduling walk runs afterwards and would otherwise see
    state it did not create.

S6. `r_shadowMapReport` level 1 gains admission denials separately from
    an exhausted budget, tiles rendered against blocks allocated, cube
    faces, and resident memory; level 2 adds a per-light line naming
    each ownership's decision.

S7. `r_shadowMapPointHighPrecision` is documented OpenGL-only and
    announced in the Vulkan report. It also no longer partitions the
    Vulkan point cache, where toggling it discarded every resident map
    without being able to change a depth cube's contents.

S8. GPU shadow-pass timings. Timestamp spans measure the pass in the two
    phases OpenGL reports: `map` (the fresh atlas scope, the compose
    scope, and the point cube faces, the same grouping GL uses) and
    `reuse` (the resident publish and restore transfers).

    OpenGL brackets each phase with `glFinish` under
    `r_shadowMapGpuSyncTimings`. Vulkan structurally cannot: the pass is
    being RECORDED, so nothing is submitted to wait for. The synchronized
    mode is applied at readback instead, where it means no sample is ever
    dropped rather than a stall for accuracy -- the wait is gated on an
    age past which the frame loop has already waited that slot's fence,
    so it returns immediately. That is a better trade than `glFinish`,
    but it is not the same behaviour.

    Three failure modes are closed deliberately: a span whose command
    buffer was never submitted ages out instead of being waited on; a
    span opened but never closed is reclaimed instead of leaking its
    query pair; and ring pressure degrades to a dropped sample, never to
    a stall. Every span opens outside a dynamic-rendering scope, because
    resetting its query pair inside one is illegal.

## Still open

- `r_shadowMapDebugOverlay` (the shadow mini-map with its stats readout)
  remains OpenGL-only. It is a separate 2D pass with its own program
  (`glprogs/shadow_debug_overlay.*`), not part of the receiver shaders
  S4 covered. `r_shadowMapDebugMode 1` already visualizes atlas UV and
  depth per pixel, which is why this was ranked last.
- Translucent shadow moments stay excluded on Vulkan, per the Phase F
  closure.

## Validation

Build plus the token-pinning suite; no in-game runs in this track.

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build/meson_setup.ps1 compile -C builddir
python tools/tests/renderer_vulkan_shadow_compatibility.py
python tools/tests/renderer_vulkan_world_interaction_compatibility.py
python tools/tests/vk_shader_header_pin.py
python tools/tests/macos_shadow_policy.py
```

Each stage extended `renderer_vulkan_shadow_compatibility.py` with pins
for the contract it introduced, and each new pin was checked by breaking
the source it guards and confirming the failure. Token pins cannot cover
runtime behaviour, so S1 (lights lose their stencil volumes), S2 (moving
casters compose over cached tiles) and S5 (which lights spend a limited
budget) still want the user's own gameplay sign-off before the
`r_useShadowMap` default flip is reconsidered.
