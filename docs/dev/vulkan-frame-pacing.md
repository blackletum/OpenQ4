# Vulkan frame pacing investigation

Status: unresolved. Vulkan remains experimental. This investigation separates
CPU work, GPU execution and synchronization waits; it does not establish a
performance improvement or complete renderer qualification.

## Reproduction and localization

The v56 stock `game/storage1` comparison retained five runs before and five
after the point-shadow correction. All ten exceeded the unchanged 28 ms CPU
p99 budget, at approximately 0.39–0.41 seconds. Their GPU p99 stayed below
10 ms. These are live SP scenes, not frozen visual comparisons. The v58 entry
audit confirms that this map command selects the `first` entity filter and
starts the scripted drop-pod sequence; it is not a static indoor viewpoint.

The v57 probe uses the same 1280×720 windowed, 240 FPS limit, vsync-off,
stencil-shadow profile with 360 settling frames and 1,200 sampling frames.
PBR, HDR, bloom, temporal AA, post AA and MSAA are disabled. Mouse/controller
input is disabled. Engine `screenshot` supplies the retained images.

The first unchanged-runtime CSV records six CPU frames over 28 ms in its
256-frame history. Command scopes then localize the long frames to the first
render-target command. Finer scopes identify the frame-slot fence wait:

| Diagnostic | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Ordinary wait, with status queried first | 28 waits of 364–401 ms; the fence is unsignaled before each wait and signaled afterward. |
| Repeated 1 ms waits, still requiring completion | 29 waits of 371–461 ms, requiring 292–370 calls. This does not fix the stall. |
| Hidden window explicitly unable to take input focus | 28 waits of 358–405 ms; the stall persists. |
| Visible window explicitly unable to take input focus | 16 waits of 405–456 ms; visibility alone does not fix it. |

All are on the local RTX 4060 Laptop GPU / Windows / NVIDIA 591.74 setup.
The visible probe is still a background window, not foreground gameplay
qualification. Shader work, presentation scheduling, driver behavior and
system scheduling have not yet been independently isolated. A wait on a frame
fence does not, by itself, identify which of those causes is responsible.

GPU timestamps retain their own frame number and generation. In the detailed
probe, the slow CPU rows collect results for the frame being retired, two
frames earlier, with GPU spans of roughly 0.3–1.7 ms. GPU execution spans do
not measure every delay before queue execution or host wake-up.

An OpenGL control on the same staged package also fails: CPU p99 is 464.720 ms
and GPU p99 is 458.548 ms. Its five slow CPU rows spend 438–459 ms in the
existing upload/resource-retirement scope. Vulkan's two new wait counters are
zero on every OpenGL row, as intended. This establishes a similar symptom on
both APIs; it does not yet prove that their underlying causes are identical.
Keep the GPU frame IDs when comparing the asynchronous records.

The stock capture also exposes a test limitation: the live start/cinematic
state can leave the camera obscured by nearby geometry. These runs reproduce
stalls but do not establish representative scene coverage or visual parity.
The separate v58 gameplay case below checks a settled viewpoint. Broader scene
coverage remains part of performance qualification.

The fence interpretation follows the Vulkan reference for
[`vkGetFenceStatus`](https://docs.vulkan.org/refpages/latest/refpages/source/vkGetFenceStatus.html)
and [`vkWaitForFences`](https://docs.vulkan.org/refpages/latest/refpages/source/vkWaitForFences.html).
All temporary logging, status polling, bounded waits and window-behavior changes
are removed from production. The original completion/error handling is retained.

## Retained diagnostic counters

With `r_rendererMetrics 1`, `rendererBenchmarkCapture "logs/frame-timing.csv"`
writes the current 256-frame history under the active game's save path. The CSV
appends `frameFenceWaitUs` and `acquireImageUs` to the existing columns. Acquisition
retries accumulate their API-call durations; swapchain recreation is not charged
to the acquisition counter.

Vulkan also supplies the existing final-post, window-state, submission/present
and resource-retirement counters. `swapUs` includes command-buffer submission
and presentation. `uploadRetireUs` covers reuse of the retired frame slot,
including readbacks, probe/descriptor reset, upload retirement and deferred
destruction. These are CPU durations. The GL-only finish/context phases remain
zero on Vulkan; zero in an uninstrumented field is not proof that work is free.

The probes use a diagnostic wrapper to request the optional CSV and admit the
existing stable candidate runtime path. They are not unmodified, replay-qualified
benchmark runs. Original failed reports are retained. No performance threshold,
rendering quality or support status changes.

Evidence, exact runtime/source identities, temporary source variants, engine
logs and captures are under `.tmp/vulkan-gap-closure/frame-stall/`.
`analysis.json` correlates the CPU rows, fence scopes and delayed GPU records.

The final staged build passes the existing benchmark contract self-test and
the Vulkan startup/render-target, HDR/restart and temporal-motion GPU groups,
with zero tracked warning signatures. The shared benchmark self-test also
passes with an explicit hidden, input-disabled launch override; its generic
matrix entry does not itself supply those settings.

The final Vulkan gameplay trace has 256 consecutive CPU samples and six long
frames. Frame-fence waits account for 96.1–97.8% of those CPU intervals. Maximum
measured acquisition is 36 microseconds and submission/presentation is
1,003 microseconds. Every delayed GPU record retains the retiring frame's
identity. Both final GL/Vulkan gameplay probes exit cleanly, but their timing
budgets still fail. The retained change improves observability, not performance.

## Storage1 entry and viewpoint correction

The old `sp-storage1` description called the stock start a static gameplay view.
The map loader actually defaults this map to `first`, which runs the drop-pod
intro. In the retained v58 control, the camera moves 27,935 world units and
15.6 degrees between the sampling endpoints. That workload remains a useful
scripted-sequence test but cannot establish static indoor coverage.

The stock `second` entry starts on a moving lift. A 360-frame settling probe
still moves 68.7 world units during sampling; 720 settling frames reaches the
stationary landing. The reference script and map were checked byte-for-byte
against the installed retail PK4 entries before defining this case.

The harness preserves `sp-storage1` as an explicit first-entry case and adds
`sp-storage1-second` to the required scene list. Both assert their actual map
and entity filter and record the render-view pose at each endpoint. The second
entry waits at least 720 frames and checks the settled origin
`(-2592, 2504, 4.2)` and angles `(0, 90, 0)`, allowing one world unit and one
degree for pose rounding or small view motion. Schema-5 replay binds the case,
scene contract, generated config and engine-log observations. Missing, altered,
conflicting, non-finite or moving endpoint evidence fails. This is an endpoint
check, not continuous-motion or visual-parity qualification.

Unmodified harness runs against the unchanged v57 staged runtime give:

| Scene | Backend | CPU p99 | GPU p99 | Camera endpoint result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| First-entry intro | Vulkan | 401.216 ms | 1.986 ms | Motion recorded; no static claim |
| Settled second entry | Vulkan | 399.167 ms | 7.262 ms | Expected pose, zero measured endpoint drift |
| Settled second entry | OpenGL | 462.683 ms | 455.567 ms | Expected pose, zero measured endpoint drift |

All three exit cleanly and have zero tracked warning signatures. Performance
probes disable Vulkan validation; these are not validation-layer qualification
runs. Engine screenshots show the same unobscured landing viewpoint on both
APIs, with live animation differences. Each report still fails the unchanged
28 ms p99 budget, and replay preserves that failure. Camera/entry checks and
negative replay tests pass. No engine, renderer, shader or game binary changes
are made for this correction.

Evidence is under `.tmp/vulkan-gap-closure/gameplay-pose/`, including both failed
diagnostic probes, three schema-5 reports, engine screenshots, source/runtime
identities and `view-analysis.json`. First- and second-entry results must be
compared separately; changing the workload does not measure a speedup.

## GPU queue and adapter investigation

The v59 probes retain the settled second-entry workload, unchanged runtime,
1280x720 hidden window, disabled input, live simulation and 28 ms p99 budget.
PBR, HDR, post AA, MSAA and Vulkan validation are disabled. GPU-only Windows
ETW traces span ten seconds of gameplay; every retained trace reports zero
lost buffers and events. A separate CPU scheduler recording was denied by
Windows (`0x80070005`), so these traces cannot establish thread readiness or
host wake-up latency.

Provider state capture maps queue handles through their context and device to
the physical adapter. The ordinary Vulkan and OpenGL runs render on the NVIDIA
RTX 4060 Laptop GPU and submit presentation packets on Intel Iris Xe queues.
This is observed in each mapped trace, not inferred from laptop hardware.

In `vk-v59e-mapped`, all 48 wait packets with more than 28 ms between their
`UnwaitQueuePacket` and `QueuePacket/Stop` events belong to Intel queues. One
example uses synchronization object `0xffffc4096744b740`, fence value 1382:

| Event | Time relative to trace start |
|---|---:|
| NVIDIA signal packet 5517 submitted | 8063.186 ms |
| Intel wait packet 1362 submitted | 8063.273 ms |
| NVIDIA signal packet stop | 8066.916 ms |
| Intel wait packet unwait event | 8066.918 ms |
| Intel wait packet stop | 8576.111 ms |

The wait remains pending for 509.193 ms after its unwait event. The neighboring
Intel presentation packet also remains pending for 512.722 ms. OpenGL's mapped
repeat has the same pattern: 64 long waits on Intel queues, with up to
507.276 ms between unwait and stop. Its 2,874 render packets all finish within
13 ms. Earlier Vulkan evidence additionally follows a render-queue dependency
to a matching signal submitted 929.563 ms after the wait; that establishes late
submission, but does not explain why its worker submitted late.

Queue intervals include time pending and must not be described as shader
execution time. See Microsoft's [context CPU queue explanation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/context-cpu-queue).
The task-local join audit checks context, submission sequence, packet identity
and event ordering. It retains repeated queue-info events and incomplete
boundary packets separately. It also preserves completed context/sequence
reuse by other processes instead of overwriting earlier packets. There are no
ambiguous active joins or packet-identity mismatches. Exact shared-object and
positive fence values bind wait/signal candidates; OpenGL's two-context signal
is retained as two candidates, not silently collapsed to one.

### Direct-adapter control

A process-local `VK_DRIVER_FILES` override selects the installed native Intel
driver for one Vulkan run. The engine, shaders, scene, quality and benchmark
remain unchanged; GPU/driver selection changes. The override uses the
[Vulkan loader's documented driver selection](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/main/docs/LoaderInterfaceArchitecture.md#environment-variables)
and is not installed as a global setting. ETW confirms that this control's
submitted game work uses Intel alone. Returning immediately to ordinary NVIDIA
selection reproduces the stalls.

| Run | Render/presentation path | CPU p99 | GPU p99 | Budget result |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `vk-v59e-mapped` | Vulkan, NVIDIA/Intel | 395.288 ms | 9.144 ms | Fail |
| `gl-v59f-mapped` | OpenGL, NVIDIA/Intel | 503.884 ms | 497.638 ms | Fail |
| `vk-v59g-intel` | Vulkan, direct Intel | 17.583 ms | 10.624 ms | Pass |
| `vk-v59h-return` | Vulkan, NVIDIA/Intel again | 400.538 ms | 7.702 ms | Fail |

All four runs exit cleanly, retain the expected camera at both endpoints and
have zero tracked renderer warning signatures. Engine screenshots show the
expected landing; live animation still prevents a pixel-parity claim. The
direct-Intel trace has no half-second packet intervals; its largest render
packet interval is 48.934 ms, so the passing p99 does not mean every sample
meets the budget. These externally traced diagnostics do not replace the
required repeated, foreground, validation and platform qualification.

A VSync-on/FIFO control is worse under the hidden-window conditions: it never
reaches the sampling marker and the harness terminates it at 180 seconds.
Its separate warmup trace supplies adapter metadata, but no settled-view
timing result. The failure remains recorded. No present-mode default changes.

The evidence narrows the recurring stalls to the cross-adapter presentation
path in these tests. It does not isolate the responsible driver, scheduler,
power state, window condition or application interaction. It is not evidence
that all Vulkan performance gaps are external. No synchronization workaround,
quality reduction, threshold relaxation or renderer implementation change is
retained. The NVIDIA performance gate remains failed.

Traces, decoded events, join audits, adapter mappings, engine captures, failed
reports and exact runtime/source identities are retained under
`.tmp/vulkan-gap-closure/fence-scheduling/`.

## Next work

Distinguish presentation scheduling and host wake-up on the observed
NVIDIA-to-Intel path before changing synchronization. Further foreground tests
must respect the project's separate permission requirement for input/focus
control. The full scene/preset/platform performance matrix, visible gameplay
and the other implementation requirements remain open; this diagnostic result
does not reduce their scope.
